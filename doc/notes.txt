== Introduction
- definition: giving computer ability to learn without programming them
- Samuel 1959
- Tom Mitchell 81998( A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T abd some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.


== Supervised learning
- "right answers" given - Regression: produce continuous values
- Classification: discrete values
- It's given if an answer is right

== Unsupervised learning
- not given right answer
- find a cluster (google news(
- organize datacenter, social network, market segmentation

== Linear Regression Univariate (one variable)
- m: number of training (set of given results)
- x: features
- y: output
- (xi, yi) ith traning value
- h: (hypothesis) y = h(x)
== Cost function
- minimization: create a linear function given a dataset
- cost function = squared error function 1/2m sum(1,m)(h(xi) - yi)2
= Cost function intuition 
- find theta0 and theta1 so that the sum of the error with y of dataset is minimum
- Contour plots or Contour figure
- the points on same ellipse have the same value of J for theta0, theta1
== Gradient Descent
- algorithm to find minimum for Cost function
- start from a point than look around to find the steepest descent and go on with this
- depending from the starting poit youÄºl go into different local optimum
